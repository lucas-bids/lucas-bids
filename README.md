## Hello ✌️

Frontend Developer and lifelong learner. Open to new job opportunities. Currently Freelancing for companies in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

## Wait a minute. Who are you?

My name is Lucas Vidal. I'm passionate about creating interfaces and apps for humans to get the best out of technology.
I spent most of my professional days working as a freelancer for marketing agencies or starting my own companies, always seeing things from a technical point of view - from web development to marketing tools and analysis.
I also have a long experience with academic illustration, painting and digital illustration - ever since I could hold a pencil. Even though I carry it mostly as a hobby, it’s always good to have that skill to make web interfaces and the internet a more humane place.
